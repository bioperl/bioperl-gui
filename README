README for bioperl-gui

This is a group of modules, including most, if not all, of BioTkPerl
(written by Gregg Helt - see Bio/Tk/README) but also including 
Bio::Tk::SeqCanvas, a graphical interface to Bioperl Bio::SeqI compliant
objects.  It includes some documentation, but more is welcome! :)

Installation should follow perl convention, i.e.

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

This module requires BioPerl and Tk.

Any comments, suggestions, etc. should be directed to the authors,
Mark Wilkinson <mwilkinson@gene.pbi.nrc.ca>, and David Block
<dblock@gene.pbi.nrc.ca>.

The wiki docs are available at http://bioinfo.pbi.nrc.ca/dblock/wiki

Have fun!
