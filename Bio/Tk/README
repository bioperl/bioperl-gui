This directory contains the intact (at least, intact v.v. what I received from Berkeley)
contents of the BioTkPerl suite written by Gregg Helt (see the README file for more details).

Several modifications have been made to these modules, mainly dealing with drawing
vertical maps.  As such, we will designate this:

Bio::TkPerl version 0.81

I have done my best to document the code that I have added.
These modifications in no way alter the copyright of this software.

##########  What's in this directory?  ##########

bioTkperl is a port of David Searls' Tcl/Tk bioTk components to TkPerl.
The map widget also has been extended in some ways.

This is a copy of bioTkperl0.8, which includes a full TkPerl 
implementation of the bioTk sequence widget, and an almost complete 
implementation of the bioTk_Map widget, with some added features.  
It requires perl version 5.001m or higher and the TkPerl extension version 
b6 or higher (if you only have access to an earlier version of TkPerl, see 
below for compatibility issues).

Ports of several bioTk demos are included.  SequenceTut is a port of 
sequence.tut, while MapTut, CosmidTut, GeneticTut, and STSTut are all ports 
of different pieces of map.tut.  In addition I have included a demo version 
of an application I have been working on called AnnotP1.  This has 
served both as a testbed for bioTkperl and as a useful lab tool 
for analysis of P1 clones being sequenced here at the Drosophila Genome 
Center.  Data files for one P1 are included -- please do not widely 
distribute these, as some of the data is both unpublished and extremely 
tentative.  See the file annotP1_README for more details about features of 
this prototype application.

Note that I've pretty much given up on guessing where the right version of 
Perl will be, so you should either add the path to the beginning of each 
demo, or just invoke them with  "perl name_of_demo"

I've also included a simple wish-like shell, bioTkperl.  So code 
can be cut-and-pasted from the XxxTut files to a bioTkperl shell to 
step through the demos.  This should suffice until bioTk_RunTutorial gets 
ported from the bioTk Tcl version.  Alternatively, you could just run 
XxxTut under a perl interpreter, but I've found it's much better to 
demo it interactively in a bioTkperl shell.


###########  How to use bioTkperl  ###########

To use bioTkperl commands from perl, the environment variable BIOTKPERL_LIBRARY
should be set to the directory in which this file resides, e.g. using

  unix% setenv BIOTKPERL_LIBRARY /rubin/gregg/bioTkperl0.8

and the same directory should be added to the @INC array at the beginning of 
your perl program, e.g. using 

  BEGIN { push(@INC, $ENV{'BIOTKPERL_LIBRARY'}); }

The Tcl version of bioTk includes extensive documentation, which applies 
equally to the Perl version (the parts that have been ported), except for 
differences noted below.  The latest Tcl version can be found via anonymous 
ftp at cbil.humgen.upenn.edu, under /pub/bioTk.tar.Z.  

The bulk of the port is now in Tk/bioTk_Sequence.pm and Tk/bioTk_Map.pm.  
The bioTk widgets have been reimplemented as Perl classes.  Most procedures 
from the Tcl version have been replaced with method calls to the widget 
objects themselves.  The best way to get a feel for this is to look through
the tutorial demos, and compare them to sequence.tut and map.tut in the 
Tcl version.  The only part of the API which diverges somewhat from the Tcl 
version (bioTk1.3) is in the arguments to user-defined icon procedures -- 
for an example, take a look at the MapRectangle method in bioTk_Map.pm in 
bioTkperl, vs. the bioTk_MapRectangle proc in map.tcl.  However, in the 
next release I will probably change this so that the arguments to the Perl 
icon subs are the same as the arguments to the Tcl procs.

Some procedures that operated only on sequence strings (and not on the 
display) have become subroutines in a separate file, bioTk_SeqSubs.pm.  There 
are also a few utilities in Tk/bioTk_Utilities.pm.


###########  Status of the port  ############

The bioTk_Sequence widget is complete.

What hasn't been implemented in perl bioTk_Map:
    In bioTk_MapObject:
	the -raise option
	the -apart option
    General Procedures:
       bioTk_MapConfigure
       bioTk_MapCoords
       bioTk_MapUnset

I don't forsee any problems implementing the rest of bioTk_Map.  I halted 
work on the straight port once I had enough of it done that I considered it 
usable, because I wanted to keep the code small while testing it via 
implementation of a larger-than-tutorial-sized application.  This has helped 
iron out a number of bugs, and has also pointed out additional features that 
I would like.  I have started adding some of these.

What's been added in perl bioTk_Map: 
     in new (equivalent to bioTk_Map), -axis_loc option for specifying 
               reference axis (independent of any display of an axis)
     in MapAxis:
         -tags option for adding arbitrary tags to map items
         -offset is now relative to location specified in -axis_loc option
              to new (or defaults to being relative to map boundaries)

     in MapObject:
         -ataxis option for mapping objects relative to -axis_loc
         -tags option for adding arbitrary tags to map items, with
                 substitution mechanism
         -just_labels binary option, if 1 then only labels are drawn
         made -at relative to map boundaries, not canvas boundaries

     Zooming, but this is currently a method in AnnotMap, which inherits 
         from bioTk_Map.  And scale-triggered features are only implemented 
	 (crudely) in the AnnotP1 application.  I want to push this stuff 
         down into bioTk_Map soon.

I am hoping to have the rest of bioTk1.3 (general.tcl, help.tcl, 
and chromosome.tcl) ported by the end of November -- general.tcl and 
help.tcl should be pretty much straight translation, and chromosome.tcl 
is pretty small (w/o the data).  After that, I plan to concentrate on 
various implementations and enhancements of the map widget.


######   Compatibility with different versions of TkPerl   ######

    None of this bioTk port is compatible with the earlier implementation of
TkPerl (which got to version a6 I think) by Malcolm Beattie.  If you have an 
early version of the _new_ TkPerl by Nick Ing-Simmons (currently at b8), 
then this code should work, with a few adjustments.  I think it will work 
unmodified with b6 and higher.  If you're using b1 through b5, you may have 
to change a few things:

In Tk/bioTk_Map, Tk/AnnotP1, and Tk/bioTk_Sequence, you should change 
    Tk::Widget->Construct('xxxx')   to   (bless \qw(xxxx))->WidgetClass
and in the demos/applications, you should change
    $widget->update    to    Tk::update 

Please alert me to any other backward incompatibilities.
